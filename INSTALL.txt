Installation Instructions for Linux:
(We will make the package that contains the correct versions of omnet, inet and oversim)

PREREQUISITES
JDK, version 8 or later
Perl
A C/C++ compiler

You can skip steps 1-3 if by using the command sudo . install.sh if you are using MacOS, Debian, RedHat and/or Mandrake distributions.
However, omnetpp may not be compatible with all versions of linux distributions. See omnetpp-4.6/InstallGuide for all tested Linux distribtions.

GENERAL
 1. Add omnetpp-4.6/bin to your $PATH.
    
    You can temporarily add this directory to your path using:
      $ export PATH=$PATH:~/omnet_workspace/omnetpp-4.6/bin
    or permamently add it to path by adding this line into your .bashrc or .bash_profile
      $ echo -e "\n export PATH:~/omnet_workspace/omnetpp-4.6/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
    OR
      $ echo -e "\n export PATH:~/omnet_workspace/omnetpp-4.6/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
    You will need to run $ source ~/.bashrc for changes to take effect if you added it to your .bashrc. If you added this line to your .bash_profile you will need to log out and log in again for changes to take effect.
    
    If you ran "sudo . configure.sh", this line is added to your ~/.bashrc file

 2. You need to install several dependencies to use omnet. You will need packages:
      Ubuntu: bison flex qt5-default libqt5opengl5-dev tcl-dev tk-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev default-jre doxygen graphviz libwebkitgtk-1.0
      Red-Hat: bison flex tcl-devel tk-devel qt-devel libxml2-devel zlib-devel doxygen graphviz openmpi-devel libpcap-devel
      Open SUSE: bison flex tcl-devel tk-devel libqt5-qtbase-devel libxml2-devel zlib-devel doxygen graphviz libwebkitgtk-3_0-0
      
      To install on Ubuntu, run
      $ sudo apt-get update
      $ sudo apt-get install bison flex qt5-default libqt5opengl5-dev tcl-dev tk-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev default-jre doxygen graphviz libwebkitgtk-1.0

 3. Then install omnet:
      
      $ cd omnetpp-4.6
      $ ./configure
      $ make

    You can now run omnet from bash using 
    
      $ omnetpp

 4. Create a workplace anywhere (just remember the directory path). Now copy and paste the inetmanet, Oversim and MANETSIP files into your workspace. 
    Import them into Omnet using File->Import, General->Import Existing Projects Into Workspace.

If you would like to unistall omnetpp later, you can also run sudo . unistall.sh
